# Production Security Updates

## Current Setup (Good for demo)
✅ **What we have:**
- `.env` file with 600 permissions (owner-only access)
- `.my.cnf` with 600 permissions 
- SSH key authentication only
- Files not in git repository

## Production Security Upgrades

### Option 1: AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (Free tier available)
```bash
# Store secrets
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/sustainability/db-password" --value "secret" --type "SecureString"

# Retrieve in app
const password = await ssm.getParameter({Name: '/sustainability/db-password', WithDecryption: true}).promise()
```

**Benefits:**
- Free for up to 10,000 requests/month
- Encrypted at rest
- Integrated with IAM permissions
- Simple to implement

### Option 2: AWS Secrets Manager (~$0.40/month per secret)
- Automatic rotation
- Fine-grained access control
- Audit logging
- Better for complex secret management

**Benefits:**
- Automatic secret rotation
- Cross-service integration
- Detailed audit trails
- Compliance-ready

### Option 3: HashiCorp Vault (Self-hosted or cloud)
- More complex but very secure
- Good for multi-service architectures
- Dynamic secrets
- Detailed access policies

**Benefits:**
- Most comprehensive secret management
- Dynamic credential generation
- Detailed audit and compliance
- Multi-cloud support

## Recommendation for your stage:
**Keep current setup** for the founder demo phase. The security is adequate for:
- Demo/early stage
- Non-public sensitive data
- Limited user base (3-5 people)
- $20/month budget constraints

## Upgrade triggers:
- Moving to production with real customer data
- Team grows beyond 3-5 people
- Compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
- Monthly budget increases to $100+
- Multiple environments (dev/staging/prod)
- Multiple services needing secret access

## Implementation Timeline:
1. **Current (Demo phase):** File-based secrets with proper permissions
2. **Early production:** AWS Parameter Store (free)
3. **Scale phase:** AWS Secrets Manager or Vault
4. **Enterprise:** Full secret management with rotation and compliance

## Security Best Practices (Current):
- ✅ Secrets not in version control
- ✅ Proper file permissions (600)
- ✅ SSH key authentication
- ✅ Basic auth for demo protection
- ✅ Database authentication
- ✅ Regular backups

## Next Steps When Ready:
1. Evaluate secret management needs
2. Choose appropriate solution based on budget/complexity
3. Implement gradual migration
4. Add secret rotation policies
5. Implement access audit logging

Your current approach is secure enough for the demo phase. Focus on product validation first!
