   ```
   
   Or for development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Database Schema

The `sustainability_questions` table includes:
- `id` - Primary key

- `question_order` - Display order within category
- `question_text` - The actual question
- `question_type` - Systems, Best Practice, or Performance

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

## Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Ensure MySQL is running on port 3306
- Check that the `sustainability_survey` database exists
- Verify the root user has no password or update credentials in `server.js`

**Port Conflicts:**
- If port 3000 is in use, the server will show an error
- You can change the port in `server.js` or set the PORT environment variable

**Node.js Dependencies:**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that you have Node.js v14 or higher installed
